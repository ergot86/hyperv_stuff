# hyper-v stuff

## GHHv6_ch25

My code from the "Inside Hyper-V" of the *Gray Hat Hacking* book (6th edition).
Original repository: https://github.com/GrayHatHacking/GHHv6.git

Includes a framework that can be used to perform hypervisor research/fuzzing and hyper-v specific code (hypercalls, MSRs, VMBus communication).
